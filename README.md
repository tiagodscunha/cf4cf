# cf4cf

Source code for CF4CF and CF4CF-META. It contains all experimental procedures used to empirically compare multiple Collaborative Filtering algorithm selection studies. The code can be used to replicate the experiments of the following research papers:

- LR SAC
- CF4CF
- CF4CF-META

The code is organized as follows:

Folders:
-

Files:
-

All files have a prefix number, which refer to different meta-approaches:
1 - Label Ranking approaches
2 - CF4CF
3 - CF4CF-META
4 - ASLIB
5 - ALORS

Also, all files are identified by the meta-approach used, including the metafeatures. Thus, all scripts refer to a specific part of the evaluation procedure, aimed to be executed independently.
